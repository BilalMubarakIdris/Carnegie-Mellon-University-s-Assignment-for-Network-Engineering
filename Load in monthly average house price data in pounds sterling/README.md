Load in monthly average house price data in pounds sterling (£) from
Jan 1991 to Dec 2016. Download the data from canvas. (choose the file
UK monthly indices (Post ‘91)). Graph the time series and label it
carefully. Construct the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the monthly
returns defined as r(t) = [p(t)/p(t-1)]-1 and show the values for lags of
one up to 20 using a bar graph. Indicate the values of the ACF using
horizontal lines that would correspond to a statistically significant result
at p<0.05. From the ACF of monthly data is there evidence of
seasonality? Is there a trend in the time series? What is the annualized
return over this period as a percentage?
